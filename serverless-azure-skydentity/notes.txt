For serverless deployment, need to choose between Azure Container Apps, Azure Container Instances, and Azure Functions
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/containers-in-azure-overview-python?tabs=vscode-ide#deployment-container-options-in-azure 
    - Based on some research, Azure Container Instances is probably not the best choice
    - Between Azure Container Apps and Azure Functions, Azure Funtions appears to have higher costs while idle which is I think is good to consider for our case

    - For deploying a Flask app with Azure Container Apps: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/tutorial-containerize-simple-web-app?tabs=web-app-flask

Update: Everything currently in terms of the serverless function is manually set up
To build Dockerfile, as things are currently stored in Dockerhub, run 
docker build . -t kdharmarajan123/skydentity:latest -f /home/kdharmarajan/skydentity/serverless-azure-skydentity/Dockerfile
